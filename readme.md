# Good ol' project 

This is my first soul-stirring project. I work the crap out of me to complete it.

The code part is garbage ik but I do not give a single fuck about what you or anybody can thinks about it.
I will wave it proud till I die because this is really what got me into graphic programmation.

And also the result is fire imo, and I enjoy playing this silly ass game that I made on my phone when I am bored.
