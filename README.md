# Good ol' project 

This is my first soul-stirring project. I work the crap out of me to complete it.

The code part is garbage ik but I do not give a single *care*, it work and -at the time- this was what matter.

And also the result is fire imo, and I enjoy playing on this silly game on my phone when I am bored.
